Advanced Techniques You Need To Scale Your Youtube Income To The Next Level
<p>1.19 Gb</p>
<p>This Course is in English</p>
<p><strong><u>FAQ: Which course should I get? I recommend getting both courses, ing with the first course and then buying the masterclass. However, if you REALLY can only afford one, I recommend this masterclass, it will cover some of the most important basics in a step-by-step format, and will cover the in-depth strategies and techniques as well!</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>For those of you wondering if Youtube supports this system, here is a Tweet directly from Youtube Creator Support verifying that they do! They approve re-using content if you are editing (which is what this course teaches).</strong></p>
<p><strong>**FOR A LIMITED TIME, I AM NOW WORKING WITH THE OWNER OF A SOFTWARE, AND WITH THE PURCHASE OF THIS COURSE YOU WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO GAIN ACCESS TO IT!**</strong></p>
<p><strong>This software will allow you to rank ANY video you want for ANY keyword on the top of the page for both Youtube and Google, and will also assist you with monetizing a channel as well!</strong></p>
<p><strong>You do not need to use this software to be successful in this course, but mixing the two together will make your ad revenue SOAR!</strong></p>
<p>This is an advanced masterclass to build off of Make Money On Youtube Made Easy. In this course I walk you through the advanced techniques that I use to be successful and scale my Youtube channels to extremely high incomes. The Make Money On Youtube Made Easy course is intended as an overview and beginner friendly blueprint to help you get ed with making money on Youtube in a step-by-step format, but THIS advanced masterclass course will go in-depth and give the key details and secrets on how you can accomplish much more than you could with Make Money On Youtube Made Easy. This advanced masterclass is made for students who want more and who will not get overwhelmed in the details and who really want to succeed at the highest level. Basically, this course will teach you EVERYTHING I left out in Make Money On Youtube Made Easy that helps me generate over $200,000 on Youtube.</p>
<p>This course will walk you through overcoming the typical stumbling blocks that you run into when using my Make Money On Youtube Made Easy blueprint. I will teach you how to legally get around ANY content ID match and duplicate video warnings that normally stop you from uploading/making money on particular videos. I will also teach you how to quickly and easily remove watermarks from ANY video, which will enable you to legally use many Creative Commons videos you could not use before. These tips will help you be able to legally use THOUSANDS of videos that you could not use before because of the content ID match bot. I will also show you how to add your own intros and watermarks to videos quickly, easily, and for FREE, to truly make these videos your own. I will also teach you how you can legally edit and use many montages that are already available on Youtube, opening up THOUSANDS of video options you didn’t have before. This will open up thousands of possibilities and will allow you to use MANY videos that are STANDARD LICENSES! This is HUGE for passing the monetization review and making the videos you upload look like your videos!</p>
<p>I will also teach you my NUMBER ONE SECRET I use to generate more income with my videos that I have NOT shared in the past. This will enable you to generate more income with your videos than you ever could before.</p>
<p>In this course I will also give you the top niches you should use to be successful, and I will also reveal the three niches I PERSONALLY USE to generate over $400,000 on Youtube. I will walk you through an in-depth tutorial on how I use these niches to generate income with all details included.</p>
<p>This course will give extremely in-depth case studies on the three niches I use to generate income, from where I find what videos to use, which videos I choose to use and which ones I don’t, how I edit particular videos, how to create thumbnails and titles that appeal to each of my niche audiences, and examples of the types of tags I use for each niche.</p>
<p><strong>After this course you will be able to take one of the three niches I use, download the SAME videos from the SAME types of channels I use, use the SAME types of titles, tags, and thumbnails I use, and have the possibility of generating the same income I do in the SAME niches I use because these are ALL of the steps I use personally to be successful in each of these three niches.</strong></p>
<p>You will also be able to take what you learn by watching my case studies and translate them into other niches that you want to use, and also help grow the niches you already have to much higher levels than you could before. The three case studies will help you tremendously with learning the EXACT steps I take to be successful in ANY niche on Youtube.</p>
<p>In this course I will also give you in-depth ways on how you can grow your subscribers and viewers organically much more quickly using the same methods I use.</p>
<p><u>This course will also teach you a MAJOR HACK for how you can get to the monetized review with 1,000 subs and 4,000 watch hours QUICKLY and EASILY in just 2 weeks with just ONE VIDEO and easily PASS THE REVIEW!</u></p>
<p><strong>One of the biggest things you will get in this course, which is something I have NEVER shared and will NEVER share outside of this course, is how you can SKIP the monetization review process altogether (for a fee). I have personally done this same exact thing to never even have to go through the monetization process, meaning you can making money RIGHT NOW TODAY!</strong></p>
<p>If you are tired of not being able to find videos, not finding creative commons videos, not finding videos without intros or watermarks, getting content ID and duplication matches, and tired of trying to reach the monetization review and want to speed up the process, and want to making money on your channel TODAY, then this advanced masterclass is for you.</p>
<p><strong>**As a student ONLY, you will also have the opportunity to join my affiliate program and make $20 – $25 for every sale you send to Bye 9 To 5. This means you can make money by being a student, and just 7 sales will completely PAY FOR YOUR COURSE!**</strong></p>

These payments were direct deposited into my bank account (January – $1,332, February – $25,970, March – $15,835, April – $1,516, November – $18,560):</u></strong></p>

<p>My name is Jordan, also known as Bye 9 to 5. I was a business analyst at a very successfully company and have a Masters Degree in Business Psychology, but I hated my job! So I decided to do something about it. Since that time I have been blessed to be able to say bye to my 9 to 5 with over $100,000 on Youtube through Google Adsense. I have helped countless students make thousands of dollars doing the same thing, and it is my goal to help as many people as possible quit their job and live life on their own terms like I have been blessed to be able to do!</p>
