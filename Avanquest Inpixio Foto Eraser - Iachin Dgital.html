<p>Tired of taking pictures with all those unwanted background images? Have you ever wanted to just get rid of that sign behind your or those people walking by? Well now you can erase anything in your picture that you don’t want there with inPixio Photo eRaser 9.</p>

Simply “ERASE”<br />
The best photos capture a moment: a happy memory of a garden party, your favorite holiday photo or all the family finally gathered together in the same place. However, unfortunately snapshots tend to be “shot from the hip” and unwanted details can detract from the result.</p>
<p>How nice would it be to simply remove these unwanted objects? With Photo eRaser you can. Simply select the object you want to erase and click! Then use the clone tool to blend in any slight marks left behind.</p>
<p>Here are some great examples of Photo eRaser in action:</p>
<p>Remove unwanted people easily</p>
<p>Remove text, data, logos, watermarks or a tag</p>
<p>But you can also remove traffic lights, signs or wires, scaffolding or shadows etc.</p>
<p>Clone Tool<br />
Use the Clone tool to perfect your editing or to clone contrasting elements. Existing objects can be redrawn on-screen with the clone stamp. Repeat this process as often as you like to create surprising twin effects!</p>
<p>Original picture Use of “Clone Tool”</p>
<p>Advanced tools<br />
Reduce the appearance of wrinkles and clear up minor blemishes<br />
Use the Erase function to retouch portraits too. Clear up minor blemishes and reduce the appearance of wrinkles – just like the glossy magazines do!</p>
<p>Duplication with opacity</p>
<p>This key function makes it possible to accentuate or attenuate the presence of features in your photos.</p>
<p>Cropping and 90° Rotation<br />
Set the ratio of your photos yourself (1/1, 4/3, 16/9 etc.), then adjust the angle by drawing a horizontal line on your photo.</p>
<p>What’s new in InPixio Photo eRaser 9?<br />
NEW! Correction patch</p>
<p>This new, super fast correction tool allows you to get rid of imperfections, fill in or clone part of the image with just one flick of the mouse. It makes it easier to touch up areas that are hard to “reconstruct”. It can remove or add elements, even in areas that are very difficult to rebuild (steps, shading in the sky, etc.).</p>
<p>Also use the patch to retouch portraits. Eliminate minor imperfections and make wrinkles less visible, like the glossy magazines do!</p>
<p>NEW! Find tutorial videos for each Photo eRaser module<br />
To get the most out of Photo eRaser 9’s features, mini videos have been added to each of the software program’s modules in the form of tooltips, making it easier and more effective to use.</p>
<p>The old and new features of the program are explained in a fun and dynamic way. Simply hover over one of the features to reveal a demonstration of what you can do with it.</p>
